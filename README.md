# Lithograph

> We can't make testing fun, but we can make it fast and beautiful!

**🌐 Puppeteer First**: Puppeteer is natively supported to make real browser testing seamless. Access testing functions in both the node and browser environments.

**🏃🏽 Multi-Process**: Lithograph takes advantage of all your CPU cores to run tests in parallel, making traditionally slow integration testing blazingly fast.

**👩🏻‍💻 Literate Testing**: Your test suites truly become usable documentation as you embed your tests into markdown files. This README is a fully functioning test suite!

```bash

This README file is a fully functioning test suite. As you read along, you can follow the examples live by running:
